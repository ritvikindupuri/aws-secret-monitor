# AWS-Secret-Monitor

##  Overview
**aws-secret-monitor** is a cloud-native security monitoring solution that detects and responds to unauthorized access to **AWS Secrets Manager** in near real-time.  
It leverages **AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Amazon SNS** to provide rapid detection, automated alerting, and actionable insights — reducing Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and strengthening your cloud security posture.

---

## Why It Matters
Organizations need to continuously monitor secret access to:
- Prevent credential leakage and data breaches  
- Meet compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001)  
- Reduce risk exposure through rapid detection & response  

This project demonstrates **event-driven detection, real-time alerting, and actionable incident response workflows** — all aligned with cloud security best practices.

## Architecture

**How It Works:**
1. **AWS Secrets Manager** securely stores credentials and API keys.  
2. **AWS CloudTrail** logs every `GetSecretValue` API call.  
3. Logs stream into **CloudWatch Log Groups**.  
4. **Metric Filters** detect secret access events.  
5. **CloudWatch Alarms** fire when events exceed defined thresholds.  
6. **Amazon SNS** publishes notifications to subscribers.  
7. **Email Alerts** are sent to the security team for immediate investigation.

##  Implementation Details

### 1️ Logging & Tracking
- Enabled **AWS CloudTrail** to capture `GetSecretValue` calls across all regions.
- Configured log aggregation and retention in **CloudWatch Log Groups**.
- Archived logs in **Amazon S3** for long-term retention and audit compliance.

---

### 2️ Real-Time Monitoring
- Created a **CloudWatch Metric Filter** for `eventName = GetSecretValue`.
- Configured **CloudWatch Alarm** with 1-minute evaluation window.

| Setting         | Value            |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Namespace**   | `SecurityMetrics` |
| **Metric Name** | `Secret is accessed` |
| **Threshold**   | ≥ 1 event per minute |
| **Statistic**   | Sum |

---

### 3️ Incident Response Automation
- Integrated **Amazon SNS** to publish notifications on alarm state changes.
- Subscribed security team email distribution list for immediate alerts.

Includes:
- Alarm name and state
- Triggering metric and threshold
- Timestamp of event
- Direct CloudWatch console link for investigation

This dashboard provides:
- A timeline view of secret access events
- Correlation with alarm state changes
- Verification that monitoring is functioning correctly

---

##  Outcomes
-  **MTTD Reduction:** From hours to < 60 seconds  
-  **Improved SOC Capabilities:** Real-time triage and investigation  
-  **Audit-Ready Evidence:** Long-term log retention in encrypted S3 buckets  
-  **Operational Efficiency:** Fully automated, no manual log inspection required

##  Tech Stack
**Amazon KMS · AWS CloudTrail · AWS CloudWatch (Log Groups, Metric Filters, Alarms) · Amazon SNS · Amazon S3**

---

##  Why This Matters
Unlike basic logging setups, **aws-secret-monitor** is a **full event-driven detection pipeline** that demonstrates:
- **Cloud Security Architecture Expertise** – End-to-end system design
- **Operational Maturity** – Automated detection & alerting, ready for production
- **Employer-Relevant Skills** – Hands-on AWS security engineering experience

---

##  License & Use
This project is designed for **educational and portfolio purposes**, but can be adapted for real-world production environments with minimal changes.
